\title{Beta Kernel Process Modeling}
\description{
\pkg{BKP} provides tools for modeling binary or binomial
response data using the Beta Kernel Process (BKP), a flexible nonparametric
method that estimates latent probability surfaces by local kernel smoothing
with beta-binomial likelihood. The package supports efficient model
fitting, prediction with uncertainty quantification, and visualization
tools for both 1D and 2D covariates.
