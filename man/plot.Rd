\title{Plot a Beta Kernel Process (BKP) Model}
\usage{
\method{plot}{BKP}(x, ...)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{An object of class \code{"BKP"}, typically returned by the \code{\link{fit.BKP}} function.}

\item{...}{Additional arguments passed to generic plot functions (currently not used, included for S3 method consistency).}
}
\description{
Visualizes the fitted Beta Kernel Process (BKP) model according to the dimensionality of the covariate matrix \code{X}.
For 1-dimensional input, the function plots the estimated probability curve with confidence intervals and observed data points.
For 2-dimensional input, it produces contour plots for the estimated mean, confidence bounds, and uncertainty.
}
\details{
The plotting behavior depends on the dimensionality of the covariates \code{X} in the fitted BKP model:
\itemize{
\item \strong{1D covariates:} Produces a line plot of the predicted probability across the input domain.
A shaded region represents the confidence interval (default 95\%), and the observed proportions \code{y/m}
are added as points.
\item \strong{2D covariates:} Generates a 2x2 grid of contour plots showing the predicted mean, upper bound,
lower bound, and the width of the confidence interval (uncertainty).
}

If the dimension of \code{X} exceeds 2, the function will stop with an informative error.
