Description: Implements the Beta Kernel Process (BKP) model for nonparametric estimation
    of binomial and binary success probabilities. The package supports model fitting,
    prediction with uncertainty quantification, simulation from the fitted model,
    and visualization. It includes support for several kernel functions (Gaussian,
    Matérn 5/2, and Matérn 3/2) and efficient hyperparameter optimization via multi-start
    gradient-based algorithms. BKP is useful for probabilistic modeling in spatial
    statistics, machine learning, and experimental design.
