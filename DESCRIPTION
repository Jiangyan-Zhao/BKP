Description: Implements the Beta Kernel Profile (BKP) model for nonparametric probability 
    function estimation. The package provides methods for model fitting, prediction, 
    and visualization. Key features include support for multiple kernel functions 
    (Gaussian, Matern 5/2, Matern 3/2) and efficient optimization routines. Suitable for 
    applications in computational statistics and machine learning where flexible probability 
    surface estimation is required.
