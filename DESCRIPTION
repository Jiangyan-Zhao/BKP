Description: Provides methods for nonparametric modeling of binomial and multinomial success probabilities 
  via the Beta Kernel Process (BKP) and its extension, the Dirichlet Kernel Process (DKP). 
  Supports model fitting, predictive inference with uncertainty quantification, posterior simulation, 
  and visualization in one- and two-dimensional input spaces. 
  The package implements multiple kernel functions (Gaussian, Matérn 5/2, and Matérn 3/2), 
  and performs hyperparameter optimization using multi-start gradient-based search. 
  Applications include spatial statistics, probabilistic classification, and Bayesian experimental design.
