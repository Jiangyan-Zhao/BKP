## Additional comments

This is a maintenance update for the BKP package.  
To ensure CRAN policy compliance and avoid BLAS/OpenMP thread issues during vignette building,  
we have removed the package vignettes. The vignettes are available in the arXiv paper referenced in the Description field.  
All examples and tests run without errors or warnings on local checks.
